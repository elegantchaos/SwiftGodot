/// A button that represents a binary choice.
/// 
/// ``CheckButton`` is a toggle button displayed as a check field. It's similar to ``CheckBox`` in functionality, but it has a different appearance. To follow established UX patterns, it's recommended to use ``CheckButton`` when toggling it has an **immediate** effect on something. For example, it can be used when pressing it shows or hides advanced settings, without asking the user to confirm this action.
/// 
/// See also ``BaseButton`` which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.
