/// Abstract base class for the game's main loop.
/// 
/// ``MainLoop`` is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by ``SceneTree``, which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also possible to write and use one's own ``MainLoop`` subclass instead of the scene tree.
/// 
/// Upon the application start, a ``MainLoop`` implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise, the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a ``SceneTree`` is created) unless a ``MainLoop`` ``Script`` is provided from the command line (with e.g. `godot -s my_loop.gd`) or the "Main Loop Type" project setting is overwritten.
/// 
/// Here is an example script implementing a simple ``MainLoop``:
/// 
/// 
/// 
/// This object emits the following signals:
/// 
/// - ``onRequestPermissionsResult``
